# Pokedex Project
This project is one of the first I've undertaken, inspired by my passion for Pokémon. It's a simple Pokedex application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing interface where users can browse through and view information about various Pokémon species.

Features:
View detailed information about almost all Pokémon species.
Simple and intuitive user interface.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a lightweight and efficient experience.
How to Use:
Simply open the HTML file in your web browser to start exploring the world of Pokémon!
