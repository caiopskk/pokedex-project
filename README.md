# Pokedex Project
This project is one of the first I've undertaken, inspired by my passion for Pokémon. It's a simple Pokedex application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With this project, I aimed to create a visually appealing interface where users can browse through and view information about various Pokémon species.

1. Features:
- View animated images of almost all Pokémons.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a lightweight and efficient experience.
2. How to Use:
- Simply open https://caiopskk.github.io/pokedex-project/ to start exploring the collection of animated and stylized Pokémon images! Use the D-pad to prev and next or search in the searchbox below pokemon image.
